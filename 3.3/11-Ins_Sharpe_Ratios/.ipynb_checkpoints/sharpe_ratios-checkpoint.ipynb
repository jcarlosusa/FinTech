    "Sharpe ratios measure the excess return for each deviation. This will identify, in the wake of risk, how much profit is left to be gained.\n",

    "Sharpe ratios are calculated by subtracting the return of portfolio from the investment's risk-free rate. The difference is then divided by the standard deviation.\n",

    "The risk-free rate is the return that one expects if investing in securities that effectively offer a guaranteed return. Usually the return on 30-day U.S. government bills (treasuries) are used. Because such securities yield 0% (or less!) these days, rather than explicitly subtract zero from the numerator every time we calculate the Sharpe Ratio, we'll calculate Sharpe as the ratio of portfolio return relative to its risk (i.e., without the risk-free rate)."

    "\n",
    "  * `compounding_periods`: Assumed to be equal to 1 for bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `years`: The number of years constituting the duration of the bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pass the bond parameters into the `present_value` function and return the value to a variable `bond_value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compare the `bond_value` to its `price` and determine if the bond is worth purchasing or not.\n",
    "\n",

    "NPV, or net present value, compares the initial investment of a project to the sum of all the present values of the subsequent projected cash flows.

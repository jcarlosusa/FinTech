    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Sam wants to categorize banks by their market capitalizations, which is the total dollar market value of a company's outstanding shares. Because she wants to know the relationship between a certain bank and its market capitalization, Sam uses a dictionary to index bank names to the value of its market cap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sam needs to make a few changes to her dictionary of bank market caps because she noticed a few errors and omissions. Help Sam fix her dictionary of bank market caps, and even better, help her group the banks by their corresponding market capitalization tier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the [starter file](Unsolved/Core/market_cap_core.py), complete the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialize the dictionary of `banks`. Add the following key-value pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - JP Morgan Chase: 327\n",
    "  - Bank of America: 302\n",
    "  - Citigroup: 173\n",
    "  - Wells Fargo: 273\n",
    "  - Goldman Sachs: 87\n",
    "  - Morgan Stanley: 72\n",
    "  - U.S. Bancorp: 83\n",
    "  - TD Bank: 108\n",
    "  - PNC Financial Services: 67\n",
    "  - Capital One: 47\n",
    "  - FNB Corporation: 4\n",
    "  - First Hawaiian Bank: 3\n",
    "  - Ally Financial: 12\n",
    "  - Wachovia: 145\n",
    "  - Republic Bancorp: .97\n",
    "\n",
    "- Change the market cap for `Citigroup` to `170`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add a new bank `American Express` to the dictionary and set the market cap to `33`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Delete `Wachovia` from the dictionary, as it is a deprecated bank acquired by Wells Fargo in 2008.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Group banks by their corresponding market capitalization tier.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Iterate over the key-value pairs in the `banks` dictionary and calculate the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Total market capitalization\n",
    "  - Total number of banks\n",
    "  - Average market capitalization\n",
    "  - Largest bank\n",
    "  - Smallest bank\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use an if-else statement and lists to compare and group banks by their corresponding market capitalization: `mega-cap`, `large-cap`, `mid-cap`, and `small-cap`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `mega-cap`: Market capitalization greater than or equal to \\$300 billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `large-cap`: Market capitalization greater than or equal to $10 billion and less than $300 billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `mid-cap`: Market capitalization greater than or equal to $2 and less than $10 billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `small-cap`: Market capitalization greater than or equal to $300 million and less than $2 billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "Your results should look similar to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Total Market Capitalization: 1588\n",
    "Total Numer of Banks: 15\n",

    "## Activity 5 Finally Functioning!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will define a function to calculate compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for an investment portfolio. You are encouraged to work with a partner on this activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been working with Harold and Sam after hours to further develop your FinTech skills and automate your day jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "While fine-tuning your algorithms, you realize that you've written the logic to calculate compound annual growth rate three times: once for 2016, once for 2017, and once for 2018. You're annoyed that you've reinvented the wheel each time, and you're growing concerned that if you make any changes to the algorithm, you'll have to make changes in three different places.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cannot be maintained. You decide to refactor all of your code to make it as modular and reusable as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, define a function named `calculate_compound_growth_rate` that will accept three arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `beginning_balance`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ending_balance`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `years`\n",
    "\n",
    "The function should output a float as `growth_rate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularize this code so that you can dynamically calculate compound annual growth rate (CAGR) by simply calling a function with the required inputs. The results will indicate how you've been functioning as a trader.\n",
    "\n",
    "CAGR is valuable, as it calculates and predicts growth rate earnings and percent increase or decrease of a stock, portfolio, or bank account. This will be useful when trying to evaluate portfolio/stock performance or when choosing which savings account might produce the most return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compound annual growth rate formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "CAGR = (Ending balance/Beginning Balance)^(1/number of years) - 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a function `calculate_compound_growth_rate` that takes in `beginning_balance`, `ending_balance`, and `years` as input. Output `growth_rate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initialize `beginning_balance` to 29000.00.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Initialize `ending_balance` to 45000.00.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Initialize `years` to 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Call `calculate_compound_growth_rate()` and use the above values (found in Steps 3-5) to calculate and capture the result as `year_one_growth`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Update `beginning_balance` to 45000.00.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Update `ending_balance` to 47000.00.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Call `calculate_compound_growth_rate()` and capture results as `year_two_growth`.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Update `beginning_balance` to 47000.00.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Update `ending_balance` to 48930.00.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Call `calculate_compound_growth_rate()` and capture results as `year_three_growth`.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Use the Python `round()` function to round `year_one_growth`, `year_two_growth`, and `year_three_growth`. Capture these new values as new variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Use string formatting to print `year_one_growth`, `year_two_growth`, and `year_three_growth` as percents.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Quickly review the values printed on the screen, and identify the year with the highest rate of return.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of saving the `year_one_growth`, `year_two_growth`, and `year_three_growth` values in variables, add `growth_rate` to a global list named `growth_rates`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, write this logic in a new function `calculate_compound_growth_rate_list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instead of returning the local `growth_rate` variable, store it in the `growth_rates` global list object.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Refer to the [W3Schools documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_round.asp) for the Python round function.\n",
